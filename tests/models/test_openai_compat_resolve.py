"""Model-id resolution: reject empty/garbage wire ids.

`algae/<provider>/<model>` parsing used to accept empty model segments
(`algae/deepseek//foo`, trailing `algae/deepseek/`, `deepseek/`), producing a
"/foo" or "" wire id that the adapter would forward to the upstream instead of
the request being rejected as an unknown model.
