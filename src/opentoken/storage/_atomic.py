"""Atomic JSON write helpers shared by storage modules.

Plain `Path.write_text` is not atomic — a crash mid-write can leave a half-
written / unparseable JSON file. These helpers write to a sibling temp file
and then `os.replace` it onto the target, which on POSIX is guaranteed to be
atomic with respect to other readers.

The functions also lock the target file while reading/writing so that two
processes racing on the same store don't interleave their writes.
