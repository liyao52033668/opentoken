"""Cheap pre-save credential validation.

Before persisting freshly-harvested credentials (cookies, API keys) we ping
a low-cost provider endpoint to confirm the new blob actually works. If the
probe fails we keep the previously-stored credentials instead of replacing
them with a broken set. This is the credentials dry-run contract used by the
browser harvest flow.

The probe is intentionally minimal: a single GET against an authenticated
"who-am-I" / billing / homepage endpoint. The goal is to catch obvious
failures (expired session, malformed cookie) without blocking on a full
chat completion round-trip.

# Each tuple is (URL to GET, status codes that mean "authenticated"). Anything
# else (4xx auth errors, 5xx) is treated as fail.
#
# Deliberately conservative: a probe is only listed here if (a) the endpoint
# genuinely requires auth (so a 200 actually proves the credential works) AND
# (b) it accepts the SAME credential material the chat path uses. A probe that
# is stricter than the chat endpoint would false-reject a valid harvest and
# block the user from re-logging in — worse than having no probe at all. So
# unverified / homepage-style endpoints are intentionally omitted: those
# providers fall through to "trust the harvest" (probe_credentials returns
# True) rather than risk a false rejection.
#
# Verified entries:
#   - claude /api/organizations: returns 401/403 cookie-less, 200 with a valid
#     sessionKey cookie (the same cookie the completion endpoint uses).
#
# Omitted on purpose (and why):
#   - deepseek/gemini homepages always return 200 regardless of auth -> useless.
#   - kimi /api/user needs a Bearer token the cookie-only harvest may not have
#     -> would false-reject. qwen/glm /users/me endpoints are unverified.
